# Processing protein and genome files before blasting

## Proteins
vim OXT_human.fa
vim OTR_human.fa
vim LNPEP_human.fa # copied and pasted fasta files Pedro sent me, but first I put all base pairs in the same line (they were split in several lines and this gives a lot of trouble later on if unnoticed)
 
## Extracting files 
mkdir extracted_genomes
for file in GCA_*.zip; do  # Loop over each zip file
    dir_name="${file%.zip}"  # Get the directory name by removing the ".zip" extension
    mkdir "$dir_name"  # Create a directory with the same name as the zip file
    unzip "$file" -d extracted_genomes/"$dir_name"  # Extract the zip file into the corresponding directory
done

## Moving all .fna files to a separated directory
cd extracted_genomes
mkdir all_fna_files
for dir in GCA_*; do
    scp /temporario2/11217468/projects/monkey_proteins/genomes/extracted_genomes/"$dir"/ncbi_dataset/data/"$dir"/*.fna all_fna_files
    echo "Copy of $dir was sent!"
done
