# Processing protein and genome files before blasting

## Proteins
vim OXT_human.fa
vim OTR_human.fa
vim LNPEP_human.fa # copied and pasted fasta files Pedro sent me, but first I put all base pairs in the same line (they were split in several lines and this gives a lot of trouble later on if unnoticed)
 
## Extracting files 
mkdir extracted_genomes
for file in GCA_*.zip; do  # Loop over each zip file
    dir_name="${file%.zip}"  # Get the directory name by removing the ".zip" extension
    mkdir "$dir_name"  # Create a directory with the same name as the zip file
    unzip "$file" -d extracted_genomes/"$dir_name"  # Extract the zip file into the corresponding directory
done

## Moving all .fna files to a separated directory
cd extracted_genomes
mkdir all_fna_files
for dir in GCA_*; do
    scp /temporario2/11217468/projects/monkey_proteins/genomes/extracted_genomes/"$dir"/ncbi_dataset/data/"$dir"/*.fna all_fna_files && 
    echo "Copy of $dir was sent"
done
ls | grep -c GCA_ # 178

## Checking for duplicated files using R
directory <- "/temporario2/11217468/projects/monkey_proteins/genomes/extracted_genomes/all_fna_files" # set dir path 
files <- list.files(directory, full.names = TRUE)
unique_files <- unique(files)
duplicates <- files[duplicated(files)]
print(duplicates) # character(0)

## Listing all assemblies used as database 
unique_files_names <- gsub(".*/GCA_", "GCA_", unique_files) # Extract unique file names without the directory path
unique_files_names2 <- gsub("_genomic\\.fna", "", unique_files_names) # Removing trailing from genomes names
unique_files_df <- data.frame(file_name = unique_files_names2) 
write.table(unique_files_df, file = "/temporario2/11217468/projects/monkey_proteins//unique_assemblies_list.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)
